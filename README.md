Hi! My name is Samara (folks usually call me Sam)
I'm a programming enthusiast learning how to code in python and html, for now.
But I'm looking foward to learn other languages such as java, javascript, php,
css, c# and c++ (specially because of my deep interest in games). I've learned
everything I now about this subject on YouTube, programming articles and pdfs
I've found about it on the web.
My goal is to build a sound career as a programmer.

I'm also willing to collaborate in any project you guys want me to (at least to
my skills limit) and would be truly thankful to any help or advice with my own 
projects. Make some friends would also be grand!

Wish you all the best of luck with your own enterprises and achievements within
this remarkable branch!
